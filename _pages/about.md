I am working on the problem of dexterous robotic manipulation and am an incoming postdoctoral researcher at the Intelligent Robotics Group, Aalto University. Previously, I was a Marie Curie ESR at BMW Group and completed my doctoral degree at Imperial College London in December 2025. I did my master’s at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm in 2020, with an Erasmus semester at EPFL. 

I am interested in developing robust perception and control for robotic arms, focusing on contact-rich tasks and taking inspiration from cognitive principles in neuroscience.
