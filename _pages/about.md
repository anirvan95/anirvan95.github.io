I am a robotics researcher working on dexterous robotic manipulation, with a focus on developing robust perception and control frameworks for contact-rich tasks. My research draws inspiration from human sensorimotor cognition, aiming to translate principles of perception and action into safer, more generalizable, and more efficient robotic manipulation :mechanical_arm:.

I will be joining the Intelligent Robotics Group at Aalto University as a postdoctoral researcher. I completed my PhD from Imperial College London on the topic of *'Predictive Visuo-Tactile Object Perception via Robotic Manipulation'* in 2025. During this time, I was a Marie Curie Early Stage Researcher at BMW Group AG. Prior to that, I earned my Master's degree in Systems, Control and Robotics from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm (2020), and my Bachelor's degree in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, India (2017).

This page is currently brewing :coffee: and expected to be finished in early 2026!
